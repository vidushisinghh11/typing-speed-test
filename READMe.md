Typing Speed Test â€“ Python Mini Project
Description:
A simple console-based Python project that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. The program displays a sentence, times the user's input, and calculates WPM and character accuracy.

Concepts Used:
time, random, string handling, basic logic

ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Random sentence generation
- âœ… Measures typing **speed (WPM)**
- âœ… Calculates **accuracy** of typed text
- âœ… Interactive GUI using `tkinter`
- âœ… **Restart** button resets the test with a new sentence
- âœ… Clean layout and beginner-friendly code



ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. A random sentence is shown to the user.
2. Once the user clicks inside the textbox, the timer starts.
3. The user types the sentence and clicks **"Finish"**.
4. The app calculates:
   - **WPM (Words Per Minute)**
   - **Accuracy (%)**
5. Click **"Restart"** to try a new sentence with a fresh timer.
